# CholecT50 and Cholec80 Task Phase Groupings (CCTPG) Dataset

The CholecT50 and Cholec80 Task Phase Groupings Dataset is designed to support research and development in laparoscopic surgical robot systems. This dataset comprises annotated video recordings of laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures, providing valuable information on task phases and groupings.

The dataset consists of:
- Annotated video recordings from the CholecT50 and Cholec80 datasets
- Detailed task phase groupings for each video
- Ground truth annotations for key surgical phases

The dataset is primarily intended for use in developing systems for automated surgical phase recognition, task analysis, and the enhancement of robotic surgical assistance.
