# CholecT50 and Cholec80 Task Phase Groupings (CCTPG) Dataset

The CholecT50 and Cholec80 Task Phase Groupings Dataset (CCTPG) is designed to support research and development in laparoscopic surgical robot assistant systems. This dataset comprises annotated video recordings of laparoscopic cholecystectomy tasks, providing valuable information for advanced computational analysis and robotic assistance development.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of:

 - Annotated small video clips extracted from the CholecT50 and Cholec80 datasets.
 - Detailed task phase groupings for each video: Labeled sequences indicating specific surgical phases and tasks.
 - Ground truth annotations for key surgical phases: Verified annotations for critical phases in the surgical process.

The dataset is primarily intended for use in developing systems for automated surgical phase recognition, task analysis, and the enhancement of robotic surgical assistance.
