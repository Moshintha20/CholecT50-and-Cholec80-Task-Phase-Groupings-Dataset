# CholecT50 and Cholec80 Task Phase Groupings (CCTPG) Dataset

In order to train laparoscopic robotic assistants to accurately and quickly identify the stages of laparoscopic surgical procedures, it is crucial to have a well-structured dataset. This dataset not only facilitates the training of new endeavors but also aids in effectively categorizing video clips for easy understanding and classification. The CholecT50 and Cholec80 Task Phase Groupings Dataset (CCTPG) is meticulously organized based on triplet labels: Instrument, Verb, Target and designed to support research and development in laparoscopic surgical robot assistant systems. This dataset comprises annotated video recordings of laparoscopic cholecystectomy tasks, providing valuable information for advanced computational analysis and robotic assistance development.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of:

 - Annotated small video clips extracted from the CholecT50 and Cholec80 datasets.
 - Detailed triplet labeled based groupings for each video: Labeled sequences indicating the video number and frame number.

The dataset is primarily intended for use in developing systems for automated surgical phase recognition, task analysis, and the enhancement of robotic surgical assistance.
